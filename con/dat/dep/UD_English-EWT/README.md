Universal Dependencies - English Dependency Treebank
Universal Dependencies English Web Treebank v2.13 -- 2023-11-15
https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT


# Summary

A Gold Standard Universal Dependencies Corpus for English,
built over the source material of the English Web Treebank
LDC2012T13 (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T13).


# Introduction

The corpus comprises 254,820 words and 16,622 sentences, taken from five genres
of web media: weblogs, newsgroups, emails, reviews, and Yahoo! answers. See the
LDC2012T13 documentation for more details on the sources of the sentences. The
trees were automatically converted into Stanford Dependencies and then
hand-corrected to Universal Dependencies. All the basic dependency annotations have
been single-annotated, a limited portion of them have been double-annotated,
and subsequent correction has been done to improve consistency. Other aspects
of the treebank, such as Universal POS, features and enhanced dependencies, has
mainly been done automatically, with very limited hand-correction.

# Structure

This directory contains a corpus of sentences annotated using Universal
Dependencies annotation. The corpus comprises 254,820 words and 16,622
sentences, taken from various web media including weblogs, newsgroups, emails,
reviews, and Yahoo! answers; see the LDC2012T13 documentation for more details
on the source of the sentences.  The trees were automatically converted into
Stanford Dependencies and then hand-corrected to Universal Dependencies. All
the dependency annotations have been single-annotated, and a limited portion of
them have been double-annotated with interannotator agreement at approximately
96%. The sentence IDs include the genre and the filename
of the original LDC2012T13 filename.

This corpus is compatible with the CoNLL-U format defined for Universal
Dependencies. See:

   http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/format.html

The dependency taxonomy can be found on the Universal Dependencies web site:

   http://www.universaldependencies.org

For the conversion to v2, we performed an automatic conversion with extensive
spot-checking, and manual adjudication of ambiguous cases.

The enhanced dependencies were automatically obtained by running an adapted version
of the converter by Schuster and Manning (2016). These dependencies have **not** been
manually checked.

# Deviations from UD

Version 2.13 of the English UD treebank conforms to the UD guidelines in
almost all respects, but there remain the following deviations:

 - The UD dependency `flat` is largely only used for person names.
 - Dates are not annotated consistently.
