Universal Dependencies - English Dependency Treebank
Universal Dependencies English Web Treebank v2.0 -- 2017-02-15
https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English

A Gold Standard Universal Dependencies Corpus for English,
built over the source material of the English Web Treebank
LDC2012T13 (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T13).

STRUCTURE

This directory contains a corpus of sentences annotated using Universal Dependencies annotation.
The corpus comprises 254,830 words and 16,622 sentences, taken from various web media including
weblogs, newsgroups, emails, reviews, and Yahoo! answers; see the LDC2012T13 documentation for
more details on the source of the sentences.  The trees were automatically converted into Stanford
Dependencies and then hand-corrected to Universal Dependencies.  All the dependency annotations
have been single-annotated, and a limited portion of them have been double-annotated with
interannotator agreement at approximately 96%.

This corpus is compatible with the CoNLL-U format defined for Universal Dependencies. See:
http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/format.html

The dependency taxonomy can be found on the Universal Dependencies web site:

    http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/

For the conversion to v2, we performed an automatic conversion with extensive spot-checking,
and manual adjudication of ambiguous cases.

DEVIATIONS FROM UD

Version 2.0 of the English UD treebank conforms to the UD guidelines in
almost all respects, but there remains the following deviation:
 * The UD dependency 'flat' is only used for person names.

FIXES

To help improve the corpus, please alert us to any errors you find in it.
The best way to do this is to file a github issue at:
https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English/issues

We also welcome pull requests. If you want to make edits, please modify the trees
in the idividual files in the sources directory instead of making direct changes
to en-ud-{dev,test,train}.conllu.
