NLU Problem

  INP: an utterance
  OUT: dialog act -- its semantic representation, consisting of intent and (slot, value) pairs.

For example,

  INP = Hello, find me a free attraction please?
  OUT = dialogAct(intent=Inform, domain=Attraction, slot=fee, value=free)

The problem can be divided into two subtasks: 
  - intent classification: find the intent type of an utterance
  - slot tagging: identify the value of a slot

Approach:
  - Use BERT for sentence representation
  - For dialog acts such as Inform and Recommend whose values appear in the sentence, perform sequence 
    labeling to output tags in BIO format (e.g., B-Inform-fee)
  - For dialog acts that do not have actual values, for example (intent=Request, domain=Attraction, slot=fee), 
    use a binary classifier on the sentence representation to predict whether the sentence should be 
    labeled with this dialog act.
  - Context information: Use the same BERT to get the embedding of the last 3 utterances:
    [CLS] utterance-1 [SEP] utterance-2 [SEP] utterance-3 [SEP]
    The context embedding is the embedding of the [CLS] token.
